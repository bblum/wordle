this is an automatic solver for a certain popular word game

you may have seen it in action on the bird website (https://twitter.com/bubblingbeebles/status/1477776324483862533)

the algorithm is more interesting than the ipc glue code but if you are reading this readme instead of the source code i assume you are interested in the glue

it can stand alone if you want but it can also hook up to foldr.moe/hello-wordl

so to do that you need to be
- using macos or otherwise clever enough to substitute these steps
- be able to compile haskell code
- install https://github.com/socsieng/sendkeys
- paste the contents of `hax.js` into chrome's javascript console (F12)
- ensure the string "<N> letters" is rendered on the page
- quickly give window focus back to chrome within 1s of starting the solver

i am not interested in making the demo code more flexible or robust

i am only interested in ✨the algorithm✨
